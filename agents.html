        <h1>Agents</h1>
        <p>
            An <b>agent</b> is anything that can be viewed as preceiving its environment
            through its sensor and acting upon that environment through actuators. <br /><br />
            An agent consists of some sort of <span class="tooltip">Sensors<span>(cameras,sensors,rays,etc)</span></span> that
            takes in the input from its environment and feed to the agent system after processing
            the agent then response with some sort of actions with helps of their 
            <span class="tooltip">Actuators<span>(wheels,speakers,etc)</span></span>
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Types of Agents</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <details>
                    <summary>Simple Reflex Agent</summary>
                    <ul class="inner-ul">
                        <li>Simple <b>If-then,</b> <span class="tooltip">Reactive<span>Act on given input.</span></span> approach</li>
                        <li>Cannot learn from experience</li>
                        <li>If the percept is not in the agents database it cannot react properly</li>
                        <li><b>Example: simple mercury type thermostat/ heater, basic rover</b></li>
                    </ul>
                </details>
            </li>
            <li>
                <details>
                    <summary>Modal Based Reflex Agent</summary>
                    <ul class="inner-ul">
                        <li>More Reactive than Simple Reflex agents</li>
                        <li>Keeps track of the experience it collects</li>
                        <li><b>Example: Rover with sample collection</b></li>
                    </ul>
                </details>
            </li>
            <li>
                <details>
                    <summary>Goal Based Agent</summary>
                    <ul class="inner-ul">
                        <li>Has a <span class="tooltip">Proactive<span>Act after making decision</span></span> approach</li>
                        <li>
                            It generally knows some knowledge on how the environment works.
                            And it uses that knowledge to search and identify plan before acting.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            It uses a <b>Search and Plan</b> pattern that helps it do be more
                            proactive than reactive.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Example: Vaccum World Problem</b></li>
                    </ul>
                </details>
            </li>
            <li>
                <details>
                    <summary>Utility Based Agent</summary>
                    <ul class="inner-ul">
                        <li>All the agents before had only one goal but it has multiple.</li>
                        <li>
                            Uses a <b>Utility Function</b> to calculate the possibility of each
                            plan to be successful.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            It also looks into account the probability of success, how much resource
                            is needed, what is the prority of the goal, how much time will it take,
                            and many more.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Example: Auto Taxi</b></li>

        <h1>Reasoning</h1>
        <p>
            The act of describing a concept with help of some knowledge base.
            <br>
            It refers to the process of concluding some output based on the knowledge base and the input provided.
            <br>
            A reasoning system is a system that generates conclusion from avialable knowledge using logical technique
            such as deduction and induction.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            It is of two types:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <details>
                        <summary>Forward Reasoning</summary>
                        <ul class="inner-ul">
                            <li>
                                It works with a set of facts or rules towards a set of goals or conclusion. Also
                                known as event-driven mode, antecedent mode, or data-driven mode.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The steps involved in forward reasoning are: Collecting rules or facts, recogonizing the rule that
                                can succeed, conclusion is asserted to the working memory, iteratively find conclusion until solution
                                is found. 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Used in planning, monitoring,control,collecting symptoms to decide disease
                            </li>
                            <li>

                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </details>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <details>
                        <summary>Backward Reasoning</summary>
                        <ul class="inner-ul">
                            <li>
                                It works with a conclusion or goal towards the fact or rule it should have started. Also 
                                known as consequent mode, goal-driven mode, hypothesis driven mode.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The steps involved are: Derive hypothesis to the goal given, if the hypothesis is a fact we
                                found the answer if not make it a sub-goal and do the same for those sub-goals until fact is found.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Used in diagnosis: from disease telling symptoms
                            </li>
                            <li>

                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </details>

        <h1>Constraint Satisfaction</h1>
        <p>
            Constraint Satisfaction is the process of finding solution to a problem that imposes a pre condition or constraint which
            must be satisfied.
            <br>
            <br>
            It consists of the following steps:
            <ul>
                <li>Constraint are discovered and propagated as far as possible throughout the system.</li>
                <li>
                    If no solution, search begins. A guess is made and added as new constraint which can be propagated
                    and continue to finding solution.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            Examples: Suduko, Graph coloring, N-Queen, etc
            <br><br>
            We have a initial constraint given we have to solve the problem by first propagating those constraint to the sub-problems
            and solution to those sub-problem is searched and finally the solution to problem is find.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Means End Analysis</h3>
        <p>
            <b>M.E.A</b> is a process of achieving a bigger goal by first dividing the bigger goal/problem into smaller sub-goals/sub-problems 
            which have less complexity and easy to achieve and solving those sub-goals first then combining to get the final solution.

            <br>
            It consists of both forward and backward reasoning to help divide and conqure those sub-problems.
            <br><br>
            MEA relies on a set of rules that transforms one problem state into another.
            <br><br>
            The sub problems can be assigned priorities and higher priority can be solved first. The process of sub dividing the bigger problem
            into sub problem is called <b>sub-goaling</b> and the process of combining together the sub problems is called <b>gluing</b>.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            For example: a company has to get turnover of 20 million dollars in this year.
            It can be sub-goaled into marketing, prodcution, campaining.
            <br>
            Which can be further divided by marketing (in social media, newspapers, commercials),
            prodcution (new product, product to go hand to hand with new product), etc
            <br><br>
            Now those smaller goals are completed in priority order which ultimately leads to the final 
            turnover of 20 million dollars.

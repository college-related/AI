        <h1>Problem Solving</h1>
        <p>
            Problem solving is one of the important task of any AI system and it is done in a sequence of actions.

            For a agent to have a problem solving skill, it must be desinged as <b>Formulate, Search and Execute</b>
            <br>
            Here Formulate Refers to developing the alternative solutions to the problem,
            Search Refers to selecting the best alternative of all, and Execute refers to
            implementing the selected solution to solve the problem, if not solved repeat.

            <h3>Well Defined Problem(WDP)</h3>
            <p>
                A well defined problem has the followinf 4 components:

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <details>
                            <summary>Initial State</summary>
                            <p>
                                It is the state that agent starts in, it can be any random possible scenario.
                            </p>
                        </details>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <details>
                            <summary>Possible State</summary>
                            <p>Description of possible actions available to agent</p>
                        </details>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <details>
                            <summary>Goal test function</summary>
                            <p>It is a function that checks if the current state is the goal state or not</p>
                        </details>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <details>
                            <summary>Path Cost Function</summary>
                            <p>It is a function that calculates the cost to each state from the pervious state or initail state</p>
                        </details>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                In each step the <b>goal test function</b> and <b>path cost function</b> is executed.
                <br>
                The performance of agent = summation of all cost of paths from intial state to goal state.
            </p>

            <h3>Planning Algorithm</h3>
            <p>
                It is the process of planning on how to proceed with each goal on the algorithm to be designed.
            </p>
            <p>
                The two types of planning algorithms are:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <details>
                            <summary>Linear Planning</summary>
                            <ul class="inner-ul">
                                <li>It is the planning algorithm type in which each goal is solved one after another in a sequential order.</li>
                                <li>It uses Goal Stacks to accomplish its planning.</li>
                                <li>It reduces search space as not all possible goal are considered.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </details>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <details>
                            <summary>Non-Linear Planning</summary>
                            <ul class="inner-ul">
                                <li>It is the planning algorithm type in whihc multiple goal are solved at a time but not in parallel.</li>
                                <li>It uses Goal Set to accomplish its planning</li>
                                <li>It has larger search space since all possible goal ordering may have to be considered</li>
                            </ul>
                        </details>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                Some properties of planning algorithm are:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Soundness: </b>A planning algorithm is sound if all the predefiend conditions and goals are meet without violating any constraints.</li>
                    <li><b>Completness: </b>A planning algorithm is complete if a solution is found whenever one actually exists</li>
                    <li><b>Optimality: </b>A planning algorithm is optimal if the order in which solution are found is consistent with some measure of plan quality.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Production Rule system</h3>
            <p>
                It is a simple system that is build upon a production rule with condition and action.
                <br>
                A production rule consists of following components:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>A set of rules: </b> Each consisting of left side to hold the condition and right side for holding the action</li>
                    <li><b>One or more knowledge base: </b> Information about the current problem</li>
                    <li><b>A control strategy: </b>Specifying the order in which rule will be compared to database</li>
                    <li><b>A rule applier: </b>To apply the rule</li>
                </ul>

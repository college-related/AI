        <h1>TMS</h1>
        <p>
            TMS <b>(Truth Maintainence System)</b> is a system that is used in a problem solving inference where
            the truth of the knowledge base must be tautology or else the system may give error.
            <br><br>
            For example: let's say we have a problem solving inference with the following data in the knowledge Base(KB)
            <br>
            P &rarr; Q <br>
            P &rarr; R <br>
            Q &iff; T <br>
            <br>
            Say we add a new knowledge &not;Q to the system, then the line Q &iff; T becomes false or errorfull. <br>
            <br><br>
            In such cases the <b>TMS</b> comes into play and manages the truth of the KB.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <p>
            There are methods of doing so:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <details>
                        <summary>TMS</summary>
                        <ul class="inner-ul">
                            <li>It is a simple TMS where if a contradicting knowledge is found then we retract all the errorfull lines of the KB and refill with updated values.</li>
                            <li>This method is not much practical as it may take enormous amount of time.</li>
                            <li>
                                In the above example if we had <span class="tooltip">asserted<span>To put in KB</span></span>
                                &not;P then all the lines would be errorfull and assume if we had 100's of lines of fact with P
                                then we have to retract all those lines and re enter the correct one, which is time consuming and
                                not practical.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </details>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <details>
                        <summary>JTMS (Justification Based TMS)</summary>
                        <ul class="inner-ul">
                            <li>JTMS is a modification to simple TMS where we have a <b>justification</b> for each fact we assert into the KB</li>
                            <li>
                                In above example we can do: <br>
                                P <br>
                                {P, P &rarr; Q} <br>
                                {P, P &rarr; R} <br>
                                {P, Q &iff; T} <br>
                                Then all the lines of fact with P as the justification can be marked as <b>OUT</b> which means the fact is not
                                used anymore in the system.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The advantage of using justification is: we can easily find which facts are errorfull than in simple TMS, we can mark the
                                contradicting facts as <b>OUT</b> and mark them <b>IN</b> which means the fact are used again when the fact are again correct.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </details>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <details>
                        <summary>ATMS (Assumption Based TMS)</summary>
                        <ul class="inner-ul">
                            <li>ATMS is a modified version of JTMS where we can keep multiple set of possibly contradicting assumptions in the memory</li>
                            <li>It can simultaneously deal with different set of beliefs that may be mutually contradictory and investigate their consequences</li>
                        </ul>
                    </details>

            <h3>Reasoning under uncertainty</h3>
            <p>
                The problem that an Reasoning system faces doesnot always have a certainty to their solution. For example:
                random problems like Filiping coin, or other real life problems like weather forecasting all have that
                uncertainty in them.
                <br><br>
                Those type of problem doesnot have either enough domain knowledge or have some randomness in them that makes 
                the solution uncertain.
                <br>
                Though an Reasoning system must be <b>complete</b> which means it must provide a solution if there exists one,
                the fliping of coin have a solution either head or tail and the weather forecast also have a solution either rain
                or not, sunny or not. Hence Reasoning under uncertainty is important and must be in any Reasoning agent system.
            </p>
            <p>
                The two methods of Reasoning under uncertainty are:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Non-monotonic Reasoning: </b> Extending the facts or rules to reason with incomplete information, such as default reasoning.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Statistical Reasoning: </b> Representation is extended to allow some kind of numeric measure of certainty(rather than simply ture or false),
                        example: 70% chance of raining rather than saying it will rain.
                    </li>
                </ul>

            Q) What are drawbacks of propotitional logic? How it can be resolved by predicate logic? Example.
        </h4>
        <p>
            <b>-></b>
            The drawbacks of propotitional logic are:
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    We cannot represent relations like ALL, some, or none with propositional logic. 
                    <br>Example:
                    <br>All the girls are intelligent.
                    <br>Some apples are sweet.
                </li>
                <li>Propositional logic has limited expressive power.</li>
                <li>In propositional logic, we cannot describe statements in terms of their properties or logical relationships.</li>
            </ul>
            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;
            We can solve the propotional logic using predicate logic by following steps:
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    First we convert the given propotional statement to predicate statement.(i.e using variables).
                    <br>
                    For example: 2 is even(propositional) to x is even / even(x) (predicate)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Use the connectives (&and;-AND, &or;-OR, &not;-NOT)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Use quantifiers for quantitive statements. (&forall;-For all, &exist;-For some)
                    <br>
                    example: All the books are red - &forall;<sub>x</sub> book(x) &rarr; red(x)
                </li>
            </ul>

            Artificial Intelligence is the field of computer science and technology that is realted with computer systems
            that has its own intelligence, which means it can learn and  evolve in its own with out human interventions.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;
            AI winter is the term describing the decline in the investment as well as interest in the fields of AI. It usually
            occurs when the ROI (Returns of Investment) of investor is not meet, or when the AI driven product doesnot deliver
            the things it promised to do.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;
            In the 21<sup>st</sup> the technological advancement has sky rocketed and with the advancement of technology there is
            the rise of AI. With people being around smart technologies nowadays they tend to be more attracted towards automation
            also they tend to be lazy, hence the need for AI that can do heavy lifting for them when the attention is more and the
            advancement of technology is sky high it is the best time for AI to boom.

            Skolemnization is the process/step in CNF conversion from FOL to Conjuctive Form where all the existential quantifiers &exist; are removed
            or eliminated from the predicate statements. It is done by using the existential quantifier with Skolem constant
            <br>
        
            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;
            Steps for CNF conversion:
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Step 1: <b>Remove Implications &Implies;, &rarr;, &iff;, &harr;</b>
                    It can be done by using: <b>&alpha; &rarr; &beta; &Equal; &not; &alpha; &or; &beta;</b>
                    and <b>&alpha; &iff; &beta; &Equal; (&alpha; &rarr; &beta;) &and; (&beta; &rarr; &alpha;)</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Step 2: <b>Standardize variable</b> It means use new variable for each new statements 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Step 3: <b>Move negation inwards</b> It can be done as <br>
                    &not; (&forall;<sub>(x)</sub> P<sub>(x)</sub>) = &exist; &not; p<sub>(x)</sub> <br>
                    &not; (&Exists;<sub>(x)</sub> P<sub>(x)</sub>) = &forall; &not; p<sub>(x)</sub> <br>

                    &not; (&not; &alpha;) = &alpha; <br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Step 4: <b>Skolemnization</b> It is the process of removing the existential quantifier from the statements and
                    replacing them with a constant called <b>Skolem constant</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Step 5: <b>Drop univeral quantifier</b> Remove the universal quantifier from the statements.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;
            "Anything anyone eats and is not killed by is Food" to FOL: <br>

            Q) How can you make a system capable of communication in nepali language? What challenges might you encounter?
        </h4>
        <p>
            <b>-></b>
            We can make a system capable of communication in nepali language by using NLP (natural language processing) system in
            our AI system. NLP is a system that is used to understand as well as generate natural languages(language used by humans to communicate).
            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;
            We can train our AI system with nepali languages like nepali alphabets (क, ख, ग,...) and words, then sentences while
            mappping the meaning of each word and sentences to the english dictionary meanings.
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;
            The challenges that we might face when designing and creating this NLP system are:
            <br> 
            &nbsp;&nbsp;
            <ul>
                <li>Phonetic errors: Which is the error when two similar sounding words can confuse the system for example: आँट (courage) / आँत (part of inside body)</li>
                <li>Orthorgaphic errors: Which is the error due to lack of comperhension of the nepali language for exmaple: विध्यालय instead of विद्यालय</li>
                <li>Typographic errors: Which is the error due to typing mistakes for example: मालाई instead of मलाई</li>
            </ul>

            Constraint Satisfaction is the process of finding solution to a problem that imposes a pre condition or constraint which must be satisfied.
            <br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;
            It consists of the following steps:
            <ul>
                <li>Constraint are discovered and propagated as far as possible throughout the system.</li>
                <li>If no solution, search begins. A guess is made and added as new constraint which can be propagated and continue to finding solution.</li>
            </ul>
            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;
            For example: <b>SUDUKO</b>: Here we are given a pre condition of each row and column containing 1 to 9 without repetition and
            also each 3*3 section of the suduko must have 1 - 9 without repetition.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;
            We started by discovering those conditions and propageted to each cell of the suduko board.
            Then we start putting numbers in each cell considering the constraints imposed and find solution progressively.

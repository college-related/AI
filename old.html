            Q) What are drawbacks of propotitional logic? How it can be resolved by predicate logic? Example.
        </h4>
        <p>
            <b>-></b>
            The drawbacks of propotitional logic are:
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    We cannot represent relations like ALL, some, or none with propositional logic. 
                    <br>Example:
                    <br>All the girls are intelligent.
                    <br>Some apples are sweet.
                </li>
                <li>Propositional logic has limited expressive power.</li>
                <li>In propositional logic, we cannot describe statements in terms of their properties or logical relationships.</li>
            </ul>
            <br><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;
            We can solve the propotional logic using predicate logic by following steps:
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    First we convert the given propotional statement to predicate statement.(i.e using variables).
                    <br>
                    For example: 2 is even(propositional) to x is even / even(x) (predicate)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Use the connectives (&and;-AND, &or;-OR, &not;-NOT)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Use quantifiers for quantitive statements. (&forall;-For all, &exist;-For some)
                    <br>
                    example: All the books are red - &forall;<sub>x</sub> book(x) &rarr; red(x)
                </li>
            </ul>

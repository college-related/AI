        <h1>NLP (Natural Language Processing)</h1>
        <p>
            <b>NLP</b> is a part of Artificial Intelligence which consists of Natural Language Understanding
            as well as Natural Language Generation.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is the process of understanding as well as generating <span class="tooltip">natural language<span>Language used by us to communicate</span></span>
            so that human can interact with computers/devices in much more fluent and natural manner as if talking with each other.

                                For example: The word <b>unhappiness</b>
                                is divided into Prefix - un, Stem - happy, and Suffix - ness
                            </li>

                            <li>This level of analysis is concerned with the formation of clauses and forming more meaning than a single word.</li>
                            <li>
                                The goal of this process called <b>Parsing</b> is to convert the flat list of word that forms the sentences
                                into a structure that defines the units that are represented by that flat list.

                            <li>
                                A single word can have many different meanings to it and is realted with other words used in
                                the sentence.

                                By generating map of all the meaning a word can give and running through all the other words 
                                to see which meaning gives more sense is choosen.

                            <li>
                                For example: I will meet you at a diamond.
                                In this sentence the word <b>diamond</b> has many meanings like shape, baseball field, etc,
                                but the fact that <b>`at`</b> is present in the sentence makes the diamond either a time or place.

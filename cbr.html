        <h1>CBR - Case Based Reasoning</h1>
        <p>
            CBR is a reasoning and problem solving system that uses a large library of cases(problems) that it
            solved in the past to solve the new cases (unsolved present problem).

            <br><br>
            It is a cyclic and intergrated process where it uses the old cases solution and also intergate it 
            and learn from it back to the system.

            <br><br>
            The advantages of CBR systems are:
            <ul>
                <li>Almost all of the work is performed virtually in query time saving alot of memory</li>
                <li>It can be both problem solving and a self learning system</li>
                <li>It can be used in regression and classification problems</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            Some examples are: <b>CHEF, Meal planning system</b>, <b>CASEY (diagnoses cardiac diseases based on diagnosis of earlier patient)</b>, etc
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <p>
            The main 4 process of CBR are:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <details>
                        <summary>Retrive</summary>
                        <p>
                            In this step the CBR system <b>retrives</b> all the previous cases that are similar to the new
                            case presented.
                        </p>
                    </details>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <details>
                        <summary>Reuse</summary>
                        <p>
                            In this step the CBR system <b>reuses</b> the most effective case solution it can find to solve the
                            new case.
                        </p>
                    </details>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <details>
                        <summary>Revise</summary>
                        <p>
                            In this step the CBR system <b>revises</b> the solution it came up with for the new case and check if
                            that works or needs to be revised again.
                        </p>
                    </details>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <details>
                        <summary>Retain</summary>
                        <p>
                            In this step the CBR system <b>retains</b> the new revised solution to the new case if it is relaible and
                            can be useful in the future.
                        </p>
                    </details>
                </li>
            </ul>

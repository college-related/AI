        <h1>Logic</h1>
        <p>
            Logic is the process of thinking correctly. It is a act of correct reasoning.
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <p>
            There are different kinds of logic: classic logic, fuzzy logic, relevance logic,
            <b>Propositional logic(Boolean logic)</b>, <b>Predicate logic(First order predicate logic)</b>
            <br><br>
            Here we learn only two:

            <h3>Propositional Logic(Boolean Logic)</h3>
            <p>
                It is a simple form of logic where a symbol represents a fact.
                <br>
                Propositional symbol by themselves have no meaning for example:
                <br>
                A -> Ram is boy <br>
                B -> Today is hot
                <br>
                Boolean connectives are used to make complex sentences

            <h3>Predicate Logic (First Order predicate logic/calculus)</h3>
            <p>
                Predicate is an expression of one or more variable defined on some specific domain.
                <br>
                It has a rich set of vocabulory. One of main is that real world is made up of objects with 
                individual properties and identites that distinguishes them from other objects.
                <br>
                Objects are bond together with a relationship.
                <br><br>
                <b>Object</b> = people, thing, place <br>
                <b>Properties</b> = red, sweet, tall <br>
                <b>Relation</b> = brother_of, side_to, has_color <br><br>

                Predicate is a special function with range {F,T}. Predicate has a name and argument list. <br>
                For example: P(X[1], X[2], ..., X[n]) here P is the name and X[1], X[2], .. X[n] are the arguments. <br>
                When all the arguments are initiated or given then the predicate becomes proposition that is either true or false. <br>
                father(gyanendra, y) = predicate <br>
                father(gyanendra, paras) = proposition <br>

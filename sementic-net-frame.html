        <h1>Semantic Net</h1>
        <p>
            Semantic Net/ Semantic Network is a graphical representation of predicate logic using <b>nodes</b> to represent object and
            <b>arcs</b> to represent relations between them. <br>
            It is closer to way human structure things in real life. <br>
            It is easy to understand. <br>

            Princlple of Semantic net are:
            <ul>
                <li>Nodes represent object by using circles or rectangle with name</li>
                <li>Relations are represented by arcs connecting the nodes</li>
                <li>Used to generate structure or objects</li>
                <li>Used to generate rules of knowledge base</li>
            </ul>
            <br><br>
            For example:
             <br>
             like(cat, cream) <br>
             have(mammal, fur) <br>
             is_a(cat, mammal) <br>
             is_a(dog, mammal) <br>
             is_a(fido, dog) <br>
             is_a(tom, cat) <br>

        <h1>Frames</h1>
        <p>
            Frames also known as <b>Slot and Filler Structure</b> is a variant of semantic net that as collection of attributes or slots
            and associated values that describe some real world entities.
            <br><br>
            Each node of Semantic Net can be represented by a Frame. <br>
            Frame on its own doesnot help much but with enough Frame a <b>Frame System</b> can be a powerful system for encoding information to support reasoning. <br>
            <br>
            Some properties of Frame:
            <ul>
                <li>Each node is represented with a frame that consist slots/information about the object.</li>
                <li>Each Frame can be represented as a data structure</li>
                <li>Easy to understand by non-developers</li>
                <li>Has expressive power</li>
                <li>Easy to include default information and detect missing values</li>
                <li>It can be easily implemented using object oriented programming</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            For Example:
            <img src="./assets/frame.jpg" alt="Frame">
        </p>

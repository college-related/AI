        <p>
            <b>Machine Learning</b> is a part of Artificial Intelligence that deals with the automatic
            learning process of the system.
        </p>
        <p>
            It provides the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being 
            explicitly programmed.
            <br>
            The ability to learn by itself after the initial dataset and improve upon the problems and 
            further become accurate.

            <h3>Rote Learning (Parrot learning/Data Caching)</h3>
            <p>
                It is a simple learning method for Machine Learning systems where the system don't calculate but memorize the outpt.
                In other words this system simply learn the problem in repetition and memorize the output of certain input that is used
                when problem is put forward to it rather than recalculating.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                For this system to work it needs:
                <ul>
                    <li>Organized storage of information: Information must be organized and quickly accessible.</li>
                    <li>Generalization: To keep the large amount of information down to a manageable level.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

                                    <li>
                                        <b>A training example:</b> What learning program sees in the world.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <b>A goal Concept:</b> A high level description of what the program has to learn.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <b>An operational criterion:</b> A description of which concepts are usable.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <b>A domain theory:</b> A set of rules that describe the relationship between objects and action in domain.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>

            <h3>Winston's Learning Program</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    It is the early structural concept learning program developed by Patrick Henry Winston(MIT)
                </li>
                <li>
                    It introduces the concept of <b>near miss</b> which is an object that is not the instance of the concept but that is very similar to such instances.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The basic approach that winston's program took to the problem of concept formationcan be described as:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Beign with a structural description of one known instance of the concept. Call that description the <b>concept description.</b>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Examine description of other known instances of the concept. Generalize the definition to include them.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Examine description of near misses of the concept. Restrict the definition to exclude them.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </main>

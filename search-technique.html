        <h1>Search Techniques</h1>
        <p>
            <b>Search Techniques</b> is the process of searching an item from a list of element.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Types of Search Techniques</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h4>Uniformed Search<b>(Blind search)</b></h4>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Informed Search<b>(Heuristic Search)</b></h4>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <div>
            <h3>Uniformed Search</h3>
            <p>
                They have no additional information about states beyond that provided
                in problem definition.
            </p>
            <p>
                They have no preference as to which node it should explore first.
            </p>
            <p>
                Procedure: Generate successors and distinguish a goal state from non-goal state.
            </p>
            <p>
                Examples: <b>Breadth First Search, Depth First Search, Depth Limited Search, etc</b>
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3><b>1, Breadth First Search</b></h3>
            <ul class="inner-ul">
                <li>
                    The Root node is expanded first, then the successor nodes are expanded,
                    after which their successor nodes are expanded and so on.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It is also called <b>Level-by-level</b> traversing.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Downward motion procceds level by level until goal is reached
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3><b>2, Depth First Search</b></h3>
            <ul class="inner-ul">
                <li>
                    The Root node is expanded first, then the first shallow successor node is 
                    expanded till the deepest level, then traverse back to the next shallow node
                    and repeat until goal is reached.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It has a very modest memory requirements.
                </li>
            </ul>

        <div>
            <h3>Informed Search</h3>
            <p>
                Strategies that know whether one `non-goal state` is more promising than another.
            </p>
            <p>
                Employs heuristic<b>(to discover/investigative)</b> for its moves. Heuristic is a rule
                of thumb that probably leads to a solution.
            </p>
            <p>
                Examples: <b>Greedy Best First Search, A* Search, Hill Climbing</b>

                <li>
                    Greedy Best first search is a informed searching technique in which the algorithm
                    seeks minimum cost to reach the goal.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It uses <b>Heuristic function</b> to decide which node to expand.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It is neither <b>complete</b> nor <b>optimal</b>. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    It makes decisions based only on the information it has at any one step,
                    without regard to the overall problem.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>F(n) = H(n)</b>, where H(n) is the heuristic function result

            <ul class="inner-ul">
                <li>
                    A* search is a informed searching technique in which the algorithm
                    seeks minimum cost to reach the goal as well as cost to reach the node.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It is both <b>complete</b> nor <b>optimal</b>. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    It is the widely known form of best first search.

                <li>
                    <b>F(n) = G(n) + H(n)</b>, where G(n) cost to reach the node H(n) is the heuristic function result

                    Hill climbing is a Depth first search with a heuristic measurement
                </li>
                <li>
                    It is an optimization techinque that is used to find <b>Local Optimum</b>
                    solution to a computational problem. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    It starts off with a solution that is very poor compared to the optimal solution 
                    and then iteratively improves from there.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It may not give the optimal solution as it might stop looking for further solutions
                    thinking it has found the optimal solution when actually it is not.
